This is an Accordian Menu using UITableView and its related classes in Objective-C.
The Project's iOS SDK was 4.3 during the time of implementation.
You can either design the table cell using Interface Builder or directly writing out in codes.
In this small project, I performed an example of implementation of the table cells simply using Interface Builder. 
This project is already a sample of an Accordion itself. The portrayed sample here is Mega Millions Lottery.
I have performed some small tweaks to make the table cell animated smoothly. You might have a better vision of the animation when you run the application on an actual iDevice.
